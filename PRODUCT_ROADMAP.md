# Product Roadmap: Smart Office Assistant

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for the Smart Office Assistant application.

## Phase 1: Core MVP (Current Version - Simulated)

-   [x] **Employee Attendance Management**: Mark WFH, In-Office, On-Leave; specify transport; view history. (Simulated auto check-in)
-   [x] **Parking Slot Viewing**: Real-time (simulated) parking availability display.
-   [x] **Conference Room Booking**: View rooms, filter by capacity/AV/floor, book slots, cancel bookings. (Live calendar is simplified)
-   [x] **Admin Dashboard**: View attendance trends, parking usage, room occupancy via charts.
-   [x] **Role-Based Access**: Separate views/functionality for Employees and Admins.
-   [x] **Basic AI Chatbot**: Floating chatbot with a knowledge base for common queries and simple contextual suggestions.
-   [x] **PWA Basics**: Manifest for progressive web app capabilities.
-   [x] **Mock Data & Simulation**: Fully functional prototype using mock data and simulated backend operations.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality & Realism

-   **True Real-Time Updates**:
    -   Integrate WebSocket or similar technology for live updates on parking and room availability without polling.
-   **Actual Auto Check-in**:
    -   **Location-based**: Implement Geolocation API for proximity-based check-in (requires user permission).
    -   **QR Code**: Generate unique QR codes for office entry/rooms; implement QR scanning via device camera.
    -   **Wi-Fi**: Check against a list of office SSIDs for network-based check-in (platform limitations apply).
-   **Improved Room Booking Calendar**:
    -   Integrate a more robust calendar library (e.g., FullCalendar) for a richer visual experience.
    -   Support for recurring bookings.
    -   Outlook/Google Calendar integration for syncing bookings.
-   **Notifications**:
    -   In-app notifications for booking confirmations, reminders, cancellations.
    -   Optional email/push notifications.
-   **User Profile Management**:
    -   Allow users to update their details (e.g., preferred transport, vehicle information for parking).

## Phase 3: Advanced AI & Integrations

-   ** API Integration for Chatbot**:
    -   Replace mocked chatbot logic with actual calls to the Gemini/OpenAI API for more natural and intelligent conversations.
    -   Utilize chat history for better contextual understanding.
    -   Implement grounding with Google Search for up-to-date information.
-   **AI-Powered Predictions & Recommendations (Gemini/OpenAI)**:
    -   **Peak Office Day Prediction**: Analyze historical attendance to accurately predict busy days and suggest attendance.
    -   **Optimal Room Recommendation**: Based on meeting size, required AV, user preferences, and past usage patterns.
    -   **Smart Scheduling Assistant**: Help find optimal times for group meetings based on attendees' availability (requires calendar integration).
-   **AI-Driven Conflict Resolution **:
    -   Automatically detect and propose intelligent solutions for double bookings.
    -   Learn from user choices to improve suggestions.
-   **AI Auto-Release of Resources **:
    -   More sophisticated logic for detecting no-shows (e.g., combining booking data with check-in status or sensor data if available).
    -   Smartly release unused parking slots or meeting rooms.
-   **Deeper Admin Analytics**:
    -   Customizable reports and data export options.
    -   Predictive analytics for resource planning (e.g., future parking demand, room needs).
-   **Third-Party Integrations**:
    -   HR systems for employee data synchronization.
    -   Building management systems for actual sensor data (occupancy, environment).
    -   Communication platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams) for notifications and chatbot interaction.

## Phase 4: Scalability & Enterprise Features

-   **Backend & Database Implementation**:
    -   Develop a robust backend (e.g., Node.js/Python with Express/FastAPI).
    -   Choose a scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Firebase Firestore).
    -   Implement proper authentication and authorization (OAuth 2.0, JWT).
-   **User Management by Admins**:
    -   Admins can add, edit, and manage user accounts and roles.
-   **Resource Management by Admins**:
    -   Admins can add/edit/remove rooms, parking zones, etc.
    -   Configure office policies (e.g., booking rules, auto-release thresholds).
-   **Mobile Applications**:
    -   Develop native iOS and Android applications for a better mobile experience, potentially using React Native or Flutter.
-   **Accessibility (A11y) Enhancements**:
    -   Full WCAG compliance.
-   **Internationalization (i18n) & Localization (L10n)**:
    -   Support for multiple languages and regions.
-   **Security Hardening & Audits**:
    -   Regular security audits and penetration testing.
    -   Data encryption at rest and in transit.

## Future Considerations / Blue Sky

-   **Smart Building Integration**: Direct control of lighting, HVAC in booked rooms.
-   **Wayfinding**: Indoor navigation to booked rooms or parking spots.
-   **Desk Booking System**: Extend resource management to include hot-desking.
-   **Gamification**: Encourage desired behaviors (e.g., timely check-ins, releasing unused bookings) through points or badges.
-   **Feedback & Support System**: In-app mechanism for users to report issues or provide suggestions.

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated based on user feedback, technological advancements, and business priorities.
